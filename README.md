# Undyne-Battle-Remade
Recreating Undyne's battle mechanic (from undertale) as a arcade mini-game !
Runs on a standalone flash player and made in scratch (this scratch : https://scratch.mit.edu)
This is a pre-release version of UBR, a arcade minigame based on timing & reflexes,
with points to upgrade your character, options to change the games's musics and a save system using codes !
